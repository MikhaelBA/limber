# BoneByBone progress

## 7 October 2026 Foundation

Baseline: `e7c3f36`, 185 unit tests and working skeletal editor/browser smoke.

Implemented: product specification retained as reference, migration ADRs, architecture/runtime
contracts, immutable legacy fixture, deterministic test generator, lint/format/boundary checks,
and a managed-server browser test runner. ESLint 10 and Vitest 4 replace unsupported/vulnerable development-tool versions; npm audit reports zero findings.

Local verification passed: lint/boundaries, formatting, TypeScript, 185 unit tests, core/runtime and editor builds, complete browser smoke and frozen-frame regression. CI verification follows the push. Existing editor behavior is retained.

The full product is not complete. Next implementation is Phase 1 project/scene migration.

## 7 October 2026 Phase 0 complete

Commit `1e9859a`. CI run 37528484374 passed Test and Build, Docker, GitHub Pages and VPS deployment.

## 7 October 2026 Phase 1A project format and legacy migration

Implemented native schema v1 `.bbbproj`, stable project/artboard/group/image/rig IDs, hierarchy/reference validation, a reference-backed legacy rig adapter, unchanged v1/v2 Limber import, native Save/Open and full-project IndexedDB recovery. Product branding now reads BoneByBone. Spine export and all existing rig workflows remain available.

Verification: 200 unit tests passed, including immutable legacy/native fixtures, 10000 scene nodes and 1000 seeded edit/undo/redo transactions. Lint, boundaries, formatting, TypeScript, both builds and all three browser suites passed. Browser checks cover actual downloads/reopen, embedded textures, failed/future file isolation and recovery after reload.

Phase 1 remains partial: generic scene workspace/commands, multiple-artboard editing and OPFS recovery are outstanding. Unsupported complex active artboards fail explicitly rather than rendering incomplete content. Runtime `.bbb` export is not implemented by this source-format milestone.
